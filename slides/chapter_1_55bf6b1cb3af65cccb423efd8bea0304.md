`@part1`
From Wikipedia: "**Machine learning** is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) from data, without being explicitly programmed"

The focus will be on **supervised learning** in this tutorial. Supervised learning is one category of machine learning. In this case,the dataset has labeled outcomes associated with it. The goal is to learn a rule that maps the inputs to the labeled outputs.
